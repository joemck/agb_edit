This directory contains *old* versions of [ctrtool](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR), [makerom](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR) and [3dstool](https://github.com/dnasdw/3dstool). Using the latest ones causes ncch and cia aes key errors when rebuilding some(?) cias. I haven't figured out why or how to work around it, so just use these old ones for now. They are perfectly capable of working with GBA VCs.
