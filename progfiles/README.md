This directory is empty. If you build agb_edit.exe yourself, you will need to put 3 external exe files in here:

 * [ctrtool.exe](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases/tag/ctrtool-v1.0.3) (You want the win_x86 or win_x64 one.)
 * [makerom.exe](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases/tag/makerom-v0.18) (You want the win_x86_x64 one.)
 * [3dstool.exe](https://github.com/dnasdw/3dstool/releases/latest)


 Note that the way the ctrtool/makerom github page is structured, I can't link to the latest release of them. If there is a newer release than ctrtool 1.0.3 or makerom 0.18, I will need to update this page to point to them. The 3dstool link will always point to the latest release.
